    <h1>AllSpice</h1>
    <p>We don't need your life story. We just want a simple way to share recipes and save our own. Simply create an account, add your recipes, and peruse other's. No stories about grandma's kitchen or how your kids like their sandwiches with turkey on the outside, or whatever kids are into these days.</p>
    <h3>Simple. Elegant. Accessible. Delicious.</h3>

    <p>On a more practical note, AllSpice is a recipe sharing app created for Anne Hunt's website development portfolio. It features a C# and .NET backend, a Vue.js/BootStrap/Javascript frontend, MVC design pattern, and MySQL database. The authorization is provided by Auth0 and all tests were completed in Postman.</p>
